Possible Improvements:
	TwoCharts
		- restructure to remove redundancies

	Modal, PopUp
		- restructure, calling openModal() / openPopup() from outside is not good practice

	SingleLeverNum, SingleLeverChar, GroupLever
		- redundant, consider using one component for SingleLeverNum, SingleLeverChar

	Tab-TabNavigation:
	 - add swiping for use on mobile devices

	Store:
		- move appState from dataservice to separate file (store.js)
