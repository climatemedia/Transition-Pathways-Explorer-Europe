      <p>The cost of capital refers to the actual cost of financing business activity through either debt or equity capital. The discount rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows in standard discounted cash flow analysis.
Another terminology, not used here is the WACC. Used by many companies, the WACC is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, and it is used as their discount rate when budgeting for a new project. This figure is crucial in generating a fair value for the company's equity.
</p>
      <p>When the discount is high, the future returns on investments are low, which means investments yielding long term benefits are less profitable.</p>
