      <p>Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems have become more energy efficient. The replacement of one technology by another, for example through a hybrid system, is not included in this lever but in the technology and fuel share lever. Although most of the technologies are in a mature phase, the diffusion into the buildings stock makes this lever offer increased efficiency and leads to lower emissions. </p>
      <p>European and National policies for technologies substitution rate can have an impact on the average efficiency. Important aspects here would be the replacement of old and inefficient equipment, together with increased awareness for regular maintenance. This lever is expected to affect the three main components of HVAC systems â€“ energy transformation, energy distribution, and system control.</p>
