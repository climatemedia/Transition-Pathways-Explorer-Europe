    The displayed capital expenditures relate directly to the renovation activity that was initiated in the respective years and are incurred fully in that year. In more ambitious scenarios renovations are preponed meaning they are conducted earlier than in less ambitious scenarios. For the most ambitious setting of the building envelope lever, this results in a complete renovation around 2043 for most building types. Double renovations are not conducted in this model, because the renovations are assumed to be more sustainable.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to preponing, the renovations in ambitious scenarios are deeper, i.e. they save more energy and emissions. That is why they are more expensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both aspects, the deeper renovations and the earlier renovations explain the difference in the total capital expenditures between more and less ambitious scenarios at the beginning of the modelled period, for example between 2020-2035.
  </p>
  <p>
    As such incurring the capital expenditures in the first year of the renovation activity is theoretical because usually the renovation process is spread out over several years. Depending on whether it is a staged renovation or a full renovation the capital expenditures will thus spread more into later years.
