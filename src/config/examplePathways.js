Travel demand continues to rise and so does the amount of living residential are per person. Diets change very little apart from the slow decline in Bovine meat and a moderate shift towards eating more vegetables. The number of appliances per household increases and so does the demand for packaging. On the technology side, although cars become 20% more fuel efficient by 2050, sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines make up 98% of new car sales. The renovation rate of buildings tops at 1% a year and the depth of renovation is shallow. In Industry energy efficient gain top at 5% in 2050."

    "description": "This scenario portraits an Europe in which behavioural changes prioritize the adoption of sustainable practices but without reaching the full level of possible ambition. Individual travel demand slows down but does not decline, the adoption of less-carbon intensive diets is left half the way to that entailed in WHO health recomendations, the amount of residential living space per person remains constant. On the technology and fuels largely side, there is considerable progress towards the deployment of electrification of transport, new energy standards in buildings, improved industrial processes and strong deplyment of renewables. On the side of land and food the level of intensification of both crop and livestock production remains limited. The use of alternative protein sources for lifestock like insects and microalge reaches up to 10% of required ration. At the same time, any free land is converted mostly to prairies."

    "description": "This scenario portraits an Europe in which an unparalleled historical change takes place both on the side of behavioural changes prioritizing the adoption of sustainable lifestyle, and the deployment of highly costly transformational technologies and fuels. Individual travel demand is contained and slightly decreased taking advantage of tele-working/study and remote access to services. Diets European-wide converge to a flexitarian diet with low animal calorie input and food waste is reduced by 50%. Smaller living spaces are favoured and environmental-conscious attitudes rule purchasing decisions for appliances and packaging. On the technology and fuels there is unconstrained progress towards electrification of road transport and the shift to biofuels in aviation. The renovation of buildings towards improved energy standards results in 66% energy saving by 2050. The efficiency of industry process and the stitch to new materials makes use of the full technical potential available. There is a strong deployment of renewable and a shift coal phase out. On land and food the level of intensification of both crop and livestock production remains limited but the use of bioenergy capacity is fully explored. In addition potential of alternative sources for livestock like insects is fully developed."
